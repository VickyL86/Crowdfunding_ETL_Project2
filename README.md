# Crowdfunding_ETL_Project2

The Extract, Transform, Load project used Python and Pandas for data transformation and cleaning. 
Provided xlsx data files were parsed into Pandas dataframes and saved in csv files. Prepared data was also restructured 
in preparation to load into the PostGresSQ database. 

Documents included:
Jupyter Notebook - data cleaning and dataframe creation 
SQL file - schema for PostgreSQL  

Resources used:
Project was completed with the use of example activities from Pandas and ETL list comprehension modules.
We chose to use the Option 1 (Pandas) to create the contacts dataframe. Schema file was created with use of QuickDBD software. 
When importing csvs into PostgreSQL please upload the campaign file last.
